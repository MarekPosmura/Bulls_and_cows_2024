RULES OF THE GAME:
The goal of the game is to guess a secret code (usually a 4-digit number).

The code consists of digits (0â€“9) with no repeated numbers, and the secret
code cannot start with zero.

After your guess, the game will provide you with feedback:

    - Number of Bulls: Correct digit in the correct position.
    - Number of Cows: Correct digit in the wrong position.

If you correctly guess the entire secret code (all Bulls), you win the game!

The game can also be played with codes of different lengths.
You can set difficulty in the main menu.

Enjoy the challenge and beat the high score!
